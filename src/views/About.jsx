                        I am currently a second-year Web Programming student at the NSCC IT Campus. My journey into web development began with creating websites on WordPress, but I quickly decided to take my skills to the next level by enrolling in the Web Programming program.<br/><br/>
                        I have a strong interest in Front-End Development, Full-Stack Development, and UI/UX Design, and Iâ€™m excited to expand my knowledge in these areas. One of my key goals is to write clean, efficient, and reusable code that enhances the overall user experience on the web, making it as seamless and enjoyable as possible.
